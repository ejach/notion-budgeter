#### Installation
> NOTE: What you do with the `POST` request data is up to you. I ended up using a [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) workflow to interact with Notion to keep it simple. Any plugin that receives `POST` requests and interacts with Notion will work fine. Likewise, anything that is demonstrated in this guide can be customized to fit your needs.

Pre-requisites:
- [Notion](https://notion.so) account
- A Notion database with a Pipedream connection (see the [Notion guide](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/connecting-tools-to-notion))
- [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) account
- [Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) account with a [Development API Token](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/glossary/#development) and an account `client_id` and `secret` from a connected financial account (see the [Quickstart](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart) repository)

____

##### Step 1:

Log into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) and create a new workflow.


> NOTE: No matter what you do with the data, the first step in any workflow should consume the `POST` requests


Select the `New Webhook / HTTP Requests` trigger and select `HTTP Body Only`

##### Step 2:

Add a new trigger by hitting the `+` and search for `Notion` 


Under the `Notion Actions` select `Create a Page from Database`

After you create this workflow, connect your Notion account to Pipedream, and you will see your databases under `Parent Database ID`:

#### Step 3

Select the `Property Types` you wish to populate with the `POST` data

To access the data from the `POST` request, use the format `{{steps.trigger.event.$VAR}}`

The variables to be retrieved from the request are:
- `{{steps.trigger.event.expense}}` - Expense name
- `{{steps.trigger.event.amount}}` - Expense amount
- `{{steps.trigger.event.date}}` - Date posted

After everything is populated and the workflow works correctly, hit the `Deploy` button, and copy the link to be used when setting up the environment:
